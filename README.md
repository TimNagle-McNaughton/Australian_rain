# Predicting rainfall at weather stations across Australia

Weather is a difficult dark art that many of us only notice when it is inaccurate. In 1963 Edward Lorenz published his pivotal paper "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow", more well-known in pop culture as 'the butterfly effect'--complex systems are extremely sensitive to small changes in initial conditions. His findings caused him to question if long-term weather forecasting would ever be possible and feasible. 

Here we explore a simpler problem, how well can a random forest classifier predict if there was rain at a weather station today, or if there will be rain tomorrow based on common weather metrics.
